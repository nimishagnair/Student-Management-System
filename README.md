# 🧑‍🎓 Student Management System - CLI Java Project

A **console-based Java application** designed to help manage student registrations, course enrollments, and exam evaluations. This project is ideal for students learning Java and OOP concepts or for small academic institutions looking to digitize student records in a simple way.

Built with modular classes and a clear user interface, this system demonstrates the real-world application of Java programming skills in a structured and scalable manner.

- Reusable and extendable class structure

### 🧠 OOP Principles Used
- **Encapsulation**: All student and exam details are stored in dedicated classes with private fields and public methods
- **Abstraction**: Functional logic is separated from user interaction
- **Object Composition**: Exams contain subjects, students are linked with exams
- **Modularization**: Organized code structure makes future upgrades easy
